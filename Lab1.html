	  My name is Tevin Driver and have big goals for myself. I am not a first-generation college student, but I am the first to stick out college for this long, so I am proud
	  of myself for that. I plan to finish my associates degree in Arts and Science and move onto my bachelorâ€™s in criminal justice. With the hopes of one day going to a law
	  school to become a lawyer. It has been a dream of mine since I was 10 to become a lawyer to fight off the injustice that happens in our legal system that maybe one day
	  it will change for the better.

 	  I am a husband and father of 3 beautiful children who I would like nothing more than to see them happy and successful in life. I am a disabled military veteran who is now 
	  using my time to pursue my goals since I had to put my life on hold for a few years. I am taking this class because it was a requirement of me to take towards my degree,
	  but I do hope to learn a lot from this class. I am still learning computers and like to learn new things because you never know when it could be of use to you in the future, 
	  which is why I made the career moves I did in the past.
